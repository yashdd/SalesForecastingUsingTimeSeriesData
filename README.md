Sales Forecasting Using Machine Learning and Time Series Analysis
This project builds a sales forecasting model by combining machine learning with time series analysis techniques to predict future sales. It merges multiple data sources—such as transactions, holidays, oil prices, and store details—to create a comprehensive feature set.

The project utilizes:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering to enhance predictive accuracy.
XGBoost regression as the primary machine learning model, with tuning to optimize forecasting performance.
ETS and ARIMA models for exploring additional time series forecasting approaches.
Error metrics such as RMSE to evaluate and improve model performance.
Key Features
Data Integration: Merges data from multiple sources, including transactions, holiday events, oil prices, and store attributes.
Feature Engineering: Extracts date components and encodes categorical features for machine learning models.
Model Training: Implements XGBoost, ETS, and ARIMA models for comparative analysis.
Performance Evaluation: Provides model evaluation using RMSE and visualizations for actual vs. predicted sales.
